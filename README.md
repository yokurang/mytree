# mytree

[`mytree`](https://crates.io/crates/mytree) is a small Rust CLI that prints a directory tree to the terminal.  
The output can be filtered (by extension or regex), include hidden items, show long-format metadata, be streamed through a pager, written to a file (optionally **gzip**-compressed), or emitted as machine-readable JSON.
